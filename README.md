# Classification and Validation of Italian Wine Varieties Using Chemical Analysis and MAP Method

This dataset comes from a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same Italian region but from three varieties. Thirteen ingredients were found in all wines, and the data includes 483 entries, labeled (0, 1, 2) for the wine types. I divided it into 423 training and 60 testing samples, using MAP to predict accuracy.

## Description

This dataset is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region of Italy but derived from three different varieties. Analysis confirmed that thirteen ingredients were present in all three wines. There are 483 pieces of information in total, and they are labeled (0, 1, 2) to distinguish different types of wine. I divided the data into 423 training samples and 60 testing samples, and used the MAP method to predict the model's accuracy.

## Data
1. `train.csv`
2. `test.csv`

## Using Modules
1. `pandas`
