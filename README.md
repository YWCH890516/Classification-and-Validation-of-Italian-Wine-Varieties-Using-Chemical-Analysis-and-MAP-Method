# Classification-and-Validation-of-Italian-Wine-Varieties-Using-Chemical-Analysis-and-MAP-Method
This dataset comes from a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same Italian region but from three varieties. Thirteen ingredients were found in all wines, and the data includes 483 entries, labeled (0, 1, 2) for the wine types. I divided it into 423 training and 60 testing samples, using MAP to predict accuracy.


##Description
This data set is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region of Italy, but derived from three different varieties. 
Analysis confirmed thirteen ingredients were present in all three wines.There are 483 pieces of information in total,and they are labeled (0,1,2) to distinguish different types of wine. 
I divided the data into 423 training models and 60 testing models, and used MAP to predict the accuracy of this model .
